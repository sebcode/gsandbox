### Limitations

 * Request signature checking is not implemented.
 * Error responses are not properly implemented yet.

### Notes

 * Call `GET /sandbox/reset/ACCESSKEY` to delete all data for the specified account.

## Requirements

 * Web server with PHP 7
 * [PHP Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
 * [PHP Codeception](http://codeception.com/) for Tests

## Installation

 * Checkout repository to `/var/www/gsandbox` for example.
 * Call `composer install` to install dependencies.
 * `cp config.sample.php config.php`.
 * Edit `config.php` and change `storePath` to the path where data should be
   stored (e.g. `/var/gsandboxstore/`).
 * Make `storePath` readable and writeable for web server.
 * Each directory in `storePath` represents a fake Amazon AWS Access Key you
   will be using to connect to the test server. Create that directory and make
   it readable and writeable for the web server.
 * Add `127.0.0.1 gsandbox.localhost` to `/etc/hosts`

### Using PHP's Builtin Webserver

 * Run `php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 htdocs/index.php`

### Using Apache

 * Example apache virtual host:

        <VirtualHost *:8080>
          ServerName gsandbox.localhost
          DocumentRoot /var/www/gsandbox/htdocs

          <Directory /var/www/gsandbox/htdocs>
            RewriteEngine On
            RewriteBase /
            RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
            RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
            RewriteRule . index.php [L]
            SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1

            DirectoryIndex index.php
            AllowOverride All
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
          </Directory>
        </VirtualHost>

## Run Tests

 * Make sure that `$storePath/UNITTEST/vaults` exists.
 * Make sure that gsandbox is accessible via `http://gsandbox.localhost:8080/`.
 * Run `vendor/bin/codecept run`.
